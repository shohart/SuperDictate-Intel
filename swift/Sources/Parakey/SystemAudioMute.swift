// MARK: - System audio mute
//
// Mute the system output volume during recording so an open Zoom /
// Music / browser tab doesn't get captured back into the mic and
// transcribed alongside the user's voice. Done via NSAppleScript
// since there's no public AVFoundation knob for it. On release we
// only unmute if WE were the ones who muted — leave alone if the
// user had already muted manually.
//
// Threading: every AppleScript round-trip takes milliseconds at best
// and can stall for much longer under load. The hotkey path runs
// behind a session-wide CGEvent tap on the main run loop, where ANY
// main-thread stall delays every keystroke system-wide and a >1 s
// stall makes macOS disable the tap. So the recording-time mute /
// unmute scripts execute on a dedicated serial queue (the *Async
// wrappers below) and report back to the main actor. The serial
// queue is also the ordering guarantee: a mute enqueued before an
// unmute always executes before it. The synchronous isMuted() /
// unmute() remain for launch-time stale-mute recovery, which runs
// before the event tap exists.

/// Outcome of the "set volume with output muted" command plus its
/// follow-up verification read. The distinction matters for crash
/// recovery: a command that succeeded but could not be VERIFIED must
/// be assumed muted, so the recovery marker and watchdog stay armed.
/// Treating it as a failure would dismantle every recovery mechanism
/// for a mute that may well have happened, leaving the system muted
/// with no way back.
