// MARK: - Model registry hardening
//
// These historically overrode the speech-model download base URL for
// the previous CoreML-based ASR stack. Parakey's parakeet.cpp download
// path (`downloadParakeetModelIfNeeded`) uses a single hardcoded, pinned
// URL and does not consult either variable, but the hardening check
// stays as defense in depth: a value here still means either
// (a) a developer is debugging a mirror — uncommon — or (b) a process
// or LaunchAgent has injected one, which is worth surfacing regardless.
// An attacker who can plant `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` with
// `EnvironmentVariables` gets this persistence channel for free on
// every GUI app launch. Treat any value as adversarial: log it, present
// a blocking alert, refuse to start. The user fixes the env source and
// relaunches.
//
// We do not block HF_TOKEN etc. — those are auth headers some download
// tooling sends to the (unchanged) huggingface.co host; a user with
// HF_TOKEN set for unrelated tooling shouldn't be punished.
